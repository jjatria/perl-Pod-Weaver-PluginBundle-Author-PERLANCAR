0.05    2013-10-22 (SHARYANTO)

        - Make this PW bundle usable for CPAN modules as well as non-CPAN
          modules.

        - Replace Availability with Homepage::DefaultCPAN.

        - Replace SourceGitHub with Source::DefaultGitHub.

        - Replace BugsRT with Bugs::DefaultRT.

        - Rename from Pod-Weaver-PluginBundle-SHARYANTO to
          Pod-Weaver-PluginBundle-Author-SHARYANTO.

        - Add sections: Availability & SourceGitHub (because people reading the
          POD and not sco/metacpan wouldn't realize that the module is hosted on
          GitHub).

        - Add section: BugsRT.

        - Fix ordering.

0.02    2013-04-04 (SHARYANTO)
